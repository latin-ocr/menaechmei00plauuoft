MENAECHMEI. [Ι. 2. 20—27.

reading of the mss. has been maintained by Brix. 129. conara'-
rantes R. who considers this a trochaic septenarius like the preced-
ing line. 130. has been justly bracketed by Brix. 131. huic
Comus, hoc mss. 133. meo qudd malo R„ but qaod is not in the
mss. abstuli, hoc R. 1 follow Brix. damnum mss. (R), dominam

Dissaldeus more in the style of Ovid than of Plautus, amicam Brix.
134. adverti B, averti the other mss. 135. praemi mihi Gulielmius,

stage.-amat0r ‘one who is al-
ways in love'; Lambinus justly
explains ‘mirator amat ex ha-
bitu, amans ex perturbatione
<sudden passion), amicus amat
animum, amator corpus ⁷.

130. This line has no busi-
ness here, as the ‘palla’ cannot
be mentioned before v. 133. It
is, ωσι-001115 impossible to in-
terrupt the continuity of iambic
lines by a single trochaic line.

131. sic, as 1 have done.—
rerba dare is a common phrase
denoting ‘to cheat, deceive&-
catus means originally ‘ sharp’,
hence the names Cato, Catius,
Catullus, and Catilina.

132. lqn‘dus is a favour-ite
word with the comio poets, and
may be rendered ‘joily’. See
my note on Aul. 493.-—sabre=
affabre ‘in a workmanh'ke man-
ner’, comp. also Poen. 111 1, 74.

Stich. Ν 1, 64. Pl. has also the
expression fabrefacere fallaciam
Cas. v 1, 8.

133. meo malo=meo damno
or detrimento, ‘to my own loss'.

134. salute ‘to the welfare’.
One might feel tempted to con-
sider salute in this phrase as a
corrupt dative, instead of salu-
rei. Is it were an actual abla-
tive, we should rather expect
cum salute. Pareus (Lex. Plaut.
413) quotes the same use of
salute from Bacch. ιν 9, 147
and Rud. 1v 2, 5, to which Brix
adds Merc. 1v 5, 9, in which
passage we read salute maxuma,
which shows that Plautus took
salute as an abl.

135. istac, viz.praeda.

136. The expression in in-
sidias devenire is chosen on
account of Menaechmus' pre·
vious description of his trium-
