‘ overdoing’ of the part Me-
naechmus has now taken upon
himself produces a highly comic
effect.

537. hoc, together with the
braoelet.—After this line we
should assume that at least one
line has dropped out, in which
Menaechmus attempted to cor-
rect his mistake with regard to
the ⁸ armillae’.

540. We should notice the
ambiguity of the expression.
Menaechmus says ‘ depend upon
it, the cloak and the bracelet
shall be brought back at one
and the same time ',—i. e. never.

541. amabo ‘please’. The
addition of mi to the vocative
is likewise endearing.—inaures
‘ ear-rings’.

542. stalagymzum glenus
inaurium videtur siymficare
Festus p. 317. The designation
is derived from σταλαγμὸς, com-

pare our own ‘ear-drops’.—-
duom should be pronounced as
a monosyllable by way of syni-
zesis.

543. Compare the witty pas-
sage in the Asinaria 1 3, 31
sqq., in which a lover’s endea-
vours to make himself a favour-
ite with all in his mistress'
house are eloquently described.

544. The hiatus in the cae-
sura of this iambic line is ius-
tifiable on account of the strong
punctuation. In the following
line it is not, th refore, abso-
lutely necessary o write ted,
though it is very probable that
Plautus employed this form
when it came in so usefully to
avoid a hiatus.

545. sodes ‘if you please’.
aps te ‘out of your own means’.
The future perfect reddidero is
used in the sense of the simple

future.
