sura of this line may perhaps
be considered dubious, as there
is no strong pause after Apollo.
See the crit. note.

842. illa-:illice (dative).—
Though the present reading
lcimpadz'bas ardentibus may be
maintained as an instance of
the original long quantity of
the dative and ablative suffix
-bus, it is highly probable that
Plautus himself wrote lampadis,
as he generally adopts latinized
forms of Greek words Comp.
δᾷς, ὃᾷδαεταιτᾱα. Priscian vn
53 (p. 330 H.) quotes the accu-
sative lampadem from Plautus
(Cas. 1v 4, 16), but there also
we should probably write lam-
padam. See Biicheler‚ Lat.
Decl. p. 6, and Kiilmer, Ausf.
Gr. 1 p. 320.

844. q11idsi...cito.² ‘what do
you think, if 1 were to call the
servants here ?'

845. It is rather strange that

the old man does not afterwards
carry out his intention, but re-
mains where he is. We should
suppose that Menaechmus an-
ticipates the old man's plan and
by placing himself between the
house and him, finally con-
trives to leave the stage before
servants can be called out to
bind him.

846. In amplias we have an
instance of the original long
quantity of the suffix of the
comparative. It 15 not necessary
to assume that the long quan-
tity is due to the pause caused
by the change of speakers.

847. Observe the hiatus in
caesura.

848. votas=vetas. Menaech-
mus feigns to address Apol-
lo. huius = mulieris.—quicquam
parcere in the negative sentence
is said just as we might say
nihil parcere ‘to reti-ain not
a whit'. ’
