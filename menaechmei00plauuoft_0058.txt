the other mss. and Priscian. 342.

post illac 13, emended by

Gulielmius. 344. nauis should be pronounced as a monosynabic
word, like the Greek ναῦς. Comp. nauca=navita, naufragus:
ηιιιηζϊνιιῃηε. The ordinary pronunciation might be easily intro-
duced into the present passage by writing portust instead of portu

343. amittunt z dimittunt,
very common in the comio
poets.

344. The first syllable of is-
toc is used short, nnnc {n ist,
constituting a dactyL—-For the
pronunciation of nauis see crit.
note—praedatoria, λῃστρικὴ.

347. Iu prose we should say
me recte monuisse. The con-
struction is here quite like the
Greek in sentences containing
the same subject.

348. For tace ιίιῑηι see In-
trud. to Aul. p. 26.—concrepuit
ostium, ἐψόφησεν ὴ θύρα.

349. hoc, the ‘ vidulus' car-
ried by Messenio, see above v.
2:³6. —ponam = deponam.

350. sultis-:si voltis, just as
sis-:si vis, sodes=si audes.—

out of her house and falls into
the same mistake as the oook.

Menaechmus, however, resolves ·

to avail himself of this opportu-
nity and accepts her invitation .
for dinner.

351. sic, ‘thus', as 1 leave
the door, half open. -soris
should be pronounced as a pyr-
rhich, the first foot of this ana-
paestic line being a proceleus-
matic.—In abi the ending of
the imperative is shortened,
and sic ‹in forms a dactyL—
operiri, viz. eas (i. e. fores).
In some editions (e. g. Ritschl's)
we find the perverse re '
opperiri.-The words Erotium
speaks on coming out of her
house are of course addressed
to a servant who has followed
