but there is no reason to prefer this to the reading of our mss,
which are generally superior to Priscian’s citatione, nor is it
necessary to assume that prognatum arose from the parallel pas—

849. The expression in ma-
lam maynam crucem (here given
by the mss.) is nowhere else
read in Plautus, who often usos
ire in malam crucem or in malam
