Act V. Sc. vr. Messenio, the
servant of Menaechmus Sosicles,
appears in search of his master.
He mistakes Menaechmus of
Epidamnus (whom the slaves
attempt to carry off by force to
the physician's house) for his
master and rescues him out of
their hands. For tln's service

he demands his liberty—which
Menaechmus of Epidamnus
tells him he shall have, as iar
as it is in his power to bestow
it, though Messenio is quite
unknown to him. Menaechmus
then enters Erotium’s house
(v. 1048) to try once more, if
she will not let him have the
robe back to return it to his
wife—Messenio first recites a
monologue, the like of which is

found in more than one place of ·

the comedies of Plautus, eg.
at the commencement of the
fourth aot of the Aulularia.

of the proof itself is detailed in
v. 968 in the epexegetical sen-
tence beginning with ut.
