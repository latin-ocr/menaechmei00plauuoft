small detail, insignificant- at first sight, seems to help us
in nucina the Greek poet. It is a little piece of informa-
tion supplied by Athenaeus, and reproduced in our note
«η, v, 21³, lt· it bc true that slave-cooks appeared, among
all tlw pects of thc Ncw Comedy, only in the comedies of
l’oxide'ppus, wc cannot reasonably doubt that he was the
author of the Greek original, which has survived in the,
Latin adaptation of Plautus. It has been pointed out by
Ladewig, that cooks played a conspicuous part in the
plavs of Posidippus, as may still be seen from ‘che few
frag-gments extant¹3 and as Gellius 11 23 observes that the
plars of Posidippus were employed by Roman adapters,
wesmay easily suppose that Plautus was glad to avail
himself of such a capital plot which was sure to furnish
much amusement to his audience.

It lias been conjectured that the Greek original bore
the title of Δίδυμοι, which was also that of several other
plays of the New Comedy mentioned by ancient authors.
Such plays are attributed to Antiphanes, Anaxandrides,
Alcxius. Xenarchus and Euphron, and there is a Δίδυμαι
mentioned among the plays of Menander.

'rhough there are several allusions to Roman customs
in the Plautino plays—and, in fact, not one is free from
such adn·1ixtures——we need not suppose thfat the plot of
the Greek original was in any way altered by the Roman
adapter. We (lo not know when Plautus wrote his
Menaechmi, and there is not the slightest foundation for
the supposition which attributes this comedy to the
earlier part of the poet's litei-ary career. The passage re—
latmg to the kings of Syracuse is of too fantastic a nature
to justify thc conclusion that the play was acted during
thc reign of Hiero, though this has been maintained
by several scholars.

A capital critic-ism of this play has been given by
Ritsclss, Opusc. 11 735, from which we may be permitted
to extract the following observations ι

“The whole picce is full of the highest art, and
