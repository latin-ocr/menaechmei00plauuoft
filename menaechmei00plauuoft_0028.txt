a ‘nequam' does, conduct one-
self like a bad slave, do naughty
tricks.

84. eximunt ‘take out': the
sense of ‘taking' appears in
most of the compounds of emere.

85. turn introduces the se-
cond class of slaves who were
said to be compedibus vincti, v.
Sti-anus ‘ring', orig. ‘round'‚
whence the diminutive anulus,
commonly misspelt annulus.
The word occurs only here, but
is not at all dubious, as is
stated in Smith's Dict.

86. nuque sunt eae ‘all those κ

are necdless (foolish) precau-
tiong'.

87. recte ‘properly’.

88. The subject accusative
eum is easily supplied after
decet.

89. We should pronounee
apa—rostrum is applied to tho
mouth of a human being, just
as we may say ‘snout' in a
sonu-what slangy style. In
German, schnabel is jestingly
applied to a human mouth.

rostrum occurs in the same
sense as here in Petronius.—
The declension homenis, hamoni,
homonem, which is assumed by
some Plautine scholare, is not
at all warranted by the au·
thority of the mss. of Plautus,
and we therefore deem it very
rash to introduce it into the
text.

90. edit is the archaia subi„

91. suo arbitratu ‘at his
own pleasure'.—ad satim ‘un-
til he has enough’.
an old nounfatis, which formed
its accusative in im, like sitis
sitim. The adverb usque is not,
indeed, in the mss, but has
been justly added in order to
fill up the hiatus which cannot
be admitted in the present place,
as there is no pause strong
enough to justify it. The very
same phrase usque adfatim,
occurs Pl. Poen. 111 1, 31 tibi
bibas, edas (Ie alieno quantum
velis, usque <id satim. (The ad-
verb affatim is of course iden-
