613. rusum is a well-attested
form instead of rursum (i. e. rc-
uenum).

614. vin=visne.

615. quidnam pallam sc. com-
mmoras.—Brix opines that the
verb pavere should be simply
understood of a certain hesi-
tating tone of voice, and con-
siders it impossible that any
faciel expression should be de-
signated by this werd. ‘The
two Menaechmi', he says,
‘were necessarily represented
by aotors in masks'. But as
maske were not used on the
stage in the time of Plautum
we do not agree with Brix‘s
view of this detail. Why should
not unmesked actore be able to

impersonate the two Menaech-
mi with just as much probabi-
lity? Or are the pairs of bro-
thers in Shakspere's ‘Comedy
of Errors ' on our own stage
performed by masked actors ἶ)

618. nutat(Menaechmus),‘he

619. nutare means ‘to nod '
with the head, nictare ‘ to wink ²

charming line of Naevius: alii
adnutat, alii adnictat, alium
amat, alium tenet.
