1. 1. 16—22] MENAECHMEI. 17

numquam hercle effugiet, tam etsi capital fecerit:
facile fflservabis, dum eo vinclo vincies.
ita istaec nimis lenta vincla sunt escaria:

95 quam magis extendas, tanto adstringunt artius.
nam ego ad Menaechmumhunc m'mc eo: quo ia'un diu 20
sum iudicatus, ultro eo, ut me vinciat.
nam illic homo hercle homines non alit, verum educat

adfatim). ad satim in two words B, affatim other mss, 92. with
R. according to Nonius p. 38. edepol te fuyi d: tiam d: si B.
93. pronounced spurious by Vahlen, Rh. Mus. xvr 635. 95. in·
tendas Camerarius, 96. nunc om. mss, added by Miiller Nachtr.

p. 81. Formerly hunc was changed by the editors (and R.) into
nuno. 98. hercle om. mss, added by R. homones (without hercle)

tieal with thiS.) Plautus has
also usque ad saturitatem Rud.
111 4, 53, and ad satietatem usqne
Cist. 1 1, 72.—-For cotidie see
our note on Aul. 23. The i in
the second syllable is always
long, as it is an ablatival suffix
(cotidie=qnoto die).

92. capital ‘facinusquodcapi-
tis poena luitur'. Fsssrvs p. 48 M.

93. In du‘m eo we have the
legitimate hiatus already no-
ticed on arg. 1. dum should
of course be taken in its original
temporal sense ‘as long as'.—
vinclo vincire is an instance of
the fig. etymol.

94. ita nimis lenta ‘so very
tenacious'. After this we ought
to have a consecutive sentence
with ut (ita lenta, ut quo magis
extendas, eo artius adstrinqanc) ε
but as a rule the conversational
language is not fond oi subor-
dination and prefers co-ordina-
tion of sentences in very many
places. —esearius seems to have
been coined by Plautus ; it be-
came, however, a pretty com-
mon word at a later period,
though in a slightly modified
sense. See the dict.

W. M.

95. We should expectquan-
to instead of quam. According
to Brix, quam magis instead of
quo (quanto) mayis occurs in
only four other places in Plau-
tus : Poen. 1 2, 135. Bacch.
v 1, 5. Asin. 1 3, 6. Bacch.
1v 10, 1. The correlatives quam.
mayis—tam mayis occur in Lu-
cretius, 111 700, where see Mun-
ro's note.

96. nam introduces the par-
ticular instance which is quoted
as a proof of the general maxim
previously explained. — quo
should be understood as the
correlative to eo to be supplied
in the following line in ultro eo.
We should not, therefore, ex-
plain quo of Menaechmus, as if
it were=ad quem. (The old
editions perversely read quoi.)

97. iudicatus in the sense
elsewhere expressed by adiudi-
catus. The parasite says that,
like an insolvent debtor, he
has long since been adjudged
to Menaechmus. Comp. Ter.
Phorm. 334 sq.—ut me vinciat,
'lv' ἔχῃ με ἐν φυλακῇ. He means
of course ‘vinclis escariis ’

98. The second syllable οἱ
