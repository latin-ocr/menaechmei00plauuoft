id ego malum male

ri Βα. emended by R. 972. qui nihili sunt mss. I follow Brix.
R. reads in one line :

reem-detur qui sunt nihili, is quid preti detur cib suis eris.
973. ‘haec interpretis esse certum est’ R. who has these words
in brackets As it did not appear ‘ certum’ to me, Ι have removed
the brackets. 974 sq. B gives in one line—

Verbera compedes Mole magna lassitudo fames frigus durum,
which Ι have divided into three lines, in accordance with Spengel,
de vers, eret. usu Pl. p. 13. R. reads

verbera«, compedes,
molae, lassitudo, fames, frigus durum,
and Brix also omits magna. 976. male malum B. 977. ‘vix
Plautinus, vel hoc certe loco non Plautinus' R. who transposes

δὲν ὄντες, ‘worthless fellows'.
We often read homo nihili.
Compare also v. 973, where it
has even been conjectured that
the words iymvis improbis viri.»-
are merely a foreign interpre-
tation of tlu’s line.

974. We often find the pis-
trinum (‘the pounding-mill')

971. potiora, κρείττω. ‘He
whose heart is right, Wffl think
his back of greater consequence
Than is his gullet: ay, and to
his belly Prefer his legs’. Wan-
NER.-—The words cor modeste
sitnmst, though not unintel-
ligible of themselves, are still
very strange when considered as

Latin 3 at least, we do not else-
where find an expression exact-
ly parallel to the one in our
text. Bergk proposes therefore
cor modeste. modestztrnst—which
would be a reading quite in
harmouy with the general style
of Plautus.

972. qui nihili sunt=02 μη·

mentioned among the places of
punishment for refraetory or
careless slaves. In the present
line, Persa 1 1, 22 (fui praeser-
ratus apud molas tribunus va-
pularis) and Pseud. 1v 6, 38
(ιιι det nomen acl molas coloniam)
this is designated by molae.
976. malum ‘punishment'.
