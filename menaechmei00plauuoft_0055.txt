habites? ΜΕ. qui di illos, qui illic habitant, per-

duint.

CY. insanit hic quidem, qui ipsus male dicit sibi. ³5

sulas,

310 audin, Menaechme? ME. quid vis? CY. si me con-

nummum illum quem mihi dudum pollicitu's dare
iubeAs, si sapias, porculum adferri tibi.
nam tu quidem hercle ce'rto non sanu’s satis,

315 Menaechme, qui nunc ipsus male diczis tibi. 40

ME. heu, hercle hominem molestum et odiosum

mihi.

CY. solet iocari saepe mecum illoc modo:
quam vis ridiculus est, ubi uxor nou adest.
quid ais tu? ME. quid vis, nequam? ΟΥ. satin hoc,

quod vides,

320 tribus vobis opsonatumst an opsono amplius, 45

illic mss. di homones Brix. 309. quidem R.. after Bothe, equidem
mss. id se mss, ipse R. with the Italiam, ipsus Luchs in Stude-
mund’s stud. 1 1. p. 47. 313. sanu’s Bentley, sanus mss. This
line and the following are pronounced spurious by Vahlen
Rh. Mus. xvr 635. 316. multum mss, molestum Camerarius,
comp. v. 323. R. places heu ‘extra versum’ and reads the line
itself hercle ho‘minem ineptum [not in the mss] maltum et odiosam
mihi. Brix introduces his favourite homonem. 319. inquam R.
(who was also the first to divide the persons properly). 320. vobis

308. qui (the old ablative
of the indefinite pronoun) 111
execrations has the same power
as utinam. See -my ‘note on
Ter. Phorm. 123.-perduint a
Plautina form = perdant.

309. hic quidem‘he indeed':
though he tries to fasten the
name of madman upon me, I
should rather say that he is
mad himself. -Wherever ipse is
followed by se sese sibi, Plautus
seems to have preferred the
original full form, as has been
shown by Luchs (see crit. note).

311. We should properly
expect nummo illo. This is,

however, an instance of at-
traction nearly parallel to Trin.
985, illum quem mencines, is
eyo svm.-d·11dum ‘but now '.
317 sq. These two lines are
addressed to the spectators.
318. quamvis ‘ever so much ⁵.
orig. = tam quam vis ‘ as much
as you please'.-7-idiculus
‘witty’, or ‘full of jokes’.
319. quid ais tu introduces
a new subject into the conver-
sation—In saying hoc quod vi-
des the cook shows Menaechmus
the contente of his ‘sportula’.
320. tribus should be pro-
nounced without its final ³.—
