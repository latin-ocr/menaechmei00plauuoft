INTRODUCTION.

ΤΗΕ subject of which the ‘Menaechmei’ os Plautus would
seem to be the earliest extant version, i. e. the mistakes
and ‘errors' arisi-ng from the deceptive resemblance of
two brothers, furnishes a very happy plot for a lively
comio entertainment, and has, therefore, been in great
favour with the comio poets of almost all nations of
Europe. It was formerly supposed that this plot was
derived from the Sicilian poet Epicharmus, who spent the
latter part of his life at Syracuse at the court of Hiero,
and died at the age of 90 (450 Rc.) or 97 (443 B.c.).
This view was founded on the statement of the prologue
to the Menaechmei, v. 12, according to which the plot of
the play sicelissat—an expression erroneously understood
as applying io the ›S'z'cz‘lian oriyin of the plot, while it
merely denotes that the events in the play are in some
way connected with Sicily, or that the preliminaries of
the plot take place in that island. This supposition
was further strengthened by the somewhat vague expres-
sion of Horace, Ep. 11 1, 58 (dicitur) Plautus ad eaeemplar
Siculi properare Epicharmi. But this does not mean
that Plautus ever took a plot from Epicharmus, but only
draws a parallel between the easy and. rapid development
of the single events of the plot of a Plautine play and
the plays of Epicharmus.

It is certain that Plautus derived the plots of his
plays from the rich stores of the so-called Νέα Κωμῳδία,
and it is among the numerous poets and plays of that
branch of Greek literature that we shall have to look for
the original inventor of the plot of the present play. A
