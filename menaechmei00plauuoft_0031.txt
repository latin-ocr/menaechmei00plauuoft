a. considerable number of days

vitation.

105. The reading of the mss.
domitus sum might be defended
by considering domitus as a
cornio formation -(not found
elsewhere) in the sense of ‘con-
fined to my home’ or ‘domesti-
cated’ (Brix quotes the similar
formatione ruri rurant hominm
Capt. 82, ἠε dentes dentiam
Mil. gl. 1 1, 34, in co'llumbari
celtum Rud. 111 6, 50): but in-
dependently of the quantity of
dominas (instead of which we
should rather expect domitus),
we cannot- but object to the
present sum instead of sui. We
have, therefore, adopted Mad-
vig’s ingenious emendation of
this passage—cari met ‘my
dear ones'‚ an ambiguous ex-
pression, by which he might
denote his family, though he
really means the dear sood he

eats at home. Compare tho
following line.

107. instrui is used of the
array of dishes upon a well-
served table, and of the array
of soldiers in a line of battle.
Compare the very ludicrous pas—
sage in the Captivi 1 2, 49 sqq.‚
in which the parasite Ergasilus
compares the various dishes of
a good dinner with the different
corps of an army. (The present
line has not yet been satisfac-
torily emended ; see the crit.
note.)—deserunt ‘they desert',
run away, according to the
simile indicated in instruontur.
In Greek this would be παρα-
τάττεσθαι and λείπειν τὴν τάξιν.

Acr I. Sc. 11. 110. Menaech-
mus addresses these compli-
mentary observatione to his
wife who had followed him to
the door in order to watch where
he was going.
