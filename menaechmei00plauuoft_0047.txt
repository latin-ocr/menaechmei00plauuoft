ACTVS ΙΙ.

’ MENAECHMVS ΙΙ.
ΜΕ. Voluptas nullast navitis, Messenio,

MEssnxlo.
II 1.

maior meo animo, quam si quam ex alto procul

terram conspiciunt.

MES. maior, non dicam dolo,

si adveniens terram videas, quae fuerit tua.

230 sed quaeso, quam obrem nunc Epidamnum venimus? 5

an quasi mare omnis circumimus insulas?

ΜΕ. fratrem quaesitum geminum germanum meum.
MES. nam quid modi futurumst illum quaerere?
hic annus sextust, po'stquam ei rei operam damus.

226. voluptas nulla est is the order of words in the palimpsest‚
nullast voluptas BCD. 227. si quam Brix, qum or quom the mss,
quando Placidus, Lambinus, R. aliquam quom Muller Nachtr.
p. 128. 229. εἰ Aemulus, quam si mss. 231. circuimus R.

against the mss.

Aer 11. Sc. 1. This act is
opened by Menaechmus Sosi-
cles who had been five years in
search of his twin brother and
has just arrived at Epidamnum.
His conferenee with his slave
Messenio conduces not a little
to the knowledge of the story
of this comedy. (Thornton).

227. procul‘irom afar.⁷

228. non (or haud) dicam
dolo is an idiomatic expression
denoting ‘to speak the truth'.
See my note on Trin. 90.

229. suerit ls rather strange
instead of εἰι. Menaechmughad
observed ‘it is pleasant to see
land again after a wcary voy-
age’. This is eniorced by the
slave' s remark ‘it is still more
pleasant if that land happens
to be your own native land’.
(A verycontorted and unnatural
explanation of this passage is
given by Lambinus.)

234. ire 1ιί Βα CDa, emended by Gruter.

230. venimus, ἥκομεν.

231. circumire should here
be treated as a compound verb,
i.e. it should be pronounced
in four syllables. Brix quotes
other instanees of this pronun-
ciation from Cure. 111 81. Asin.
111 3, 152. Rud. 1 2, 52. Truc.
11 4, 53. Ter. Phorm. 614, and
in the same manner we have
circunmyi in Horace, Sat. 1 9,
17.—mare is the nominative.

232. Observe the allitera—

- tion in geminum yermannm.

233. ‘nam quid = qu ulnam.—
The infinitive is often very
loosely used in the comio writers.
Here, e. g., we should rather
expect quaerendo, as we read it
in the parallel instance, Asin.
v 2, 32 quid modI, pater, am-
plexando facies? (See also the
instances enumerated in our
Index on Terence, p. 480 B.)
