700. Menaechmus is at the
end of his wits. and therefore
determines to lay the whole
business before his friends and
be advised by them. This is,
of course, a contrivance to clear
the stage for the other Me-
naeehmus.

Ac'r V. Sc. 1. Menaechmus of
Syracuse returns with the robe
he had received from Erotium.
The wife of his twin-brother
joins him and mistakes him for
her husband whom she fancies

that he does not know her. She
considers this as the greatest

insult of all, and goes to call
her father.
