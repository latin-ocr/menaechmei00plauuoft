Brix. The transposition is due to the present editor. 491. ut

The present reading seems to bc due to Brix. 494. tibi· ozam R„
but nam 0111. mss 495. Plautus probably wrote or at least
pronounoed malelicas. mihi qui male dicas sic 71. ἰ. sc. R. against
the mss.‚whieh read however hic noto insciens in the conclusion of
the line. The reading of our text is due to Brix. 497. {stam
Vahlen Rh. Mus. xvr 633, par: eam R, post eam B. The ms.
reading arose from mis-reading the original Pr: (i. e. the name of
the speaker, Peniculus) 1311111. 498. tibi nomen st mss, emended

492. For the expression
sunus fecisti prandio we should
compare the first conversation
of Menaechmus and the para-
site, above v. 154 sqq.—In
Ciceronian prose we should cer-
tainly expect absente, as the
ablativo in —i would be ad-
missible only in case absens
is used as an adjective, and

. not as a participle. But in

Plautus this distinction cannot
be admitted. For the whole
subject see Biicheler, Lat. Decl.

p2923. quoii should be read in

two syllables. In this manner

equal claim '.

495. We should probably
pronounce malda-as : see my
preface to the T1·inummu3‚ p.
vii—sciens ⁴ wittingly '‚=con-
sulco. Menaechmus cannot but
assume that the parasite inten-
tionally insults him, as he con-
siders himself to be unknown
to this stranger.

496. malam rem=verbera.
The parasite subsequently un-
derstands mala res as a defrau-
dation of food, because he con-
ceives himself to have been ill-
treated by being deprived os 1113
share of the dinner.

498. For quid nomen tibi est
see our note on v. 341.
