R. l1esitatingly; he subsequently adopted Vahleu’s correction,
though he adds that it does not appear to be altogether satis-
factory: nor is Brix entirely convinced of its absolute truth.
Perhaps we may propose tuomst eliyere ac indicam—wa om. mss„
originally added by R, who subsequently adopted Fleckeisen’s
conj. utrone, and finally proposed utrocl (N. ·Pl. Exc. 1 p. 64).
190. sies Pylades, sis mss. After v. 194 R. fancied he could discover
in the A faint truces of tiro lines instead of the one read in the
other mss. He, therefore, assumed a gap after v. 194. But Geppert

100. interim ‘meanwhile',
i. e. all the time you are speak-
ing against your wife, you show
your fondness for her bywearing
some article of her wardrobe.—
nequis quin is like ηυιι pons

191. The pun in induviae
and exuviae is easily under-
stood, though impossible to re-
produce in English. (Iu Ger-
1111111 we might say: ‘ein auszug
111011101- irau, fiir dich ein au-
zug‘.)—rosa ‘in blanditiis ama·
torum est. Asin. 111 3, 74.

192. superas=victoriam ob-
tines—qui impetrant w'z. noctes
meas3 the aposiopesis being
chosen for the sake of decency.

194. blanditur may be re-
ierred to the coaxing words

used by Erotium, but we should
also assume some endearing
gesture on her part while pro·
nouncing the preceding line.—
quod rapiat ‘which she would
like to seize’.

195. ornabas is said with a
certain emphasis: ‘if you really
loved him'.
and endearments are not of the
genuine kind; they lael< the
real fire of love, which would
fain devour the beloved object.
—Plautus furnishes numerous
instances of oportet (oportuit
oportebat) with the past parti·
ciple, e.g. Most. iv 8, 26 aurem
admotam oportuit. Other pas-
sages may be· found in my note
011 Aul. 747 and Ter. Andr.
239.—The adv, mordicus occurs
also Aul. 232, where our note
may be consulted.
