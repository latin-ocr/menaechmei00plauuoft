The hiatus after incepi may be
defended on account of the cae-
sura, but as the panse cannot
be very strong in the present
place, we should, perhaps, be
justified in assuming that some
little word has dropped out, e. g.
tantum eyo incepi.-quantmn
potes, ‘as quickly as you can'.
It is by no means necessary to
write potest, as Plautus employs
this phrase both in a persona]
and in an impersonal construc-
tion, as 1 have shown in my
note ou Aul. 119, where we
read quantum potero,

436. istos, ‘ your com-
panions ’‚ whom Messenio had
previously addressed as navales
pedes, v. 350.

437. The past participle
occasus is used in an active
sense, as in the well-known
instances pransus potus cenatus
iuratus. The expression sol
occasus would seem to have

been legal, as Gellius xv11 2, 10
quotes it from the laws of the
twelve tables. In Plautus we
have it here, below 1022, and
Epid. 1 2, 41. See also Neue,
Formenl. 11 p. 337 sq. (see. ed.).
—advorsum venire is the umal
expression ior fetehing some
one home from a dinner. Hence
such a safeguard was called ad-
vorsitor.

440. inscita is here and v.
443 merely a synonym of stulta,
but in other passages it bears a
different sense. See dict.

441. The reading of the
mss„ hic, is justly defended by

Brix, who quotes the following ,

instances: Epid. 11 2, 117 est
lucrum hic tibi amplum. Pseud.
1v 7, 100 nihil est hodie hic su·
cophantis quaestus. Rud. νδ,
58 nihil hercle hic tibi estate tu
speres. We should, therefore,
understand hic, as if the sen·
tence were est hic praeda nobis
parata, the booty lies there

ready and, as it were, only
waiting for us,
