1 8 MENAECHMEI,

[1. 1. 23-28,

recreatque: nullus melius medicinam facit.

100 itast adulescens: ipsus escae mzixumae,

Ceriz'tlis cenas deit: ita mensas extruit, 25
tant-‘is struices educinnat patinarias:

stamlsnnst in lecto, si quid de summo petas.

sed mi intervallmu iam hos dies multos fuit:

Brix. 101. Cerialis Festus, R, Cerealis De, Certalis Ba. mensas

illicis long, when adverb, but
short, when adjectival pronoun.
-For the difference between
alere nnd educare compare No-
nius 422, 10 alere est victu
temporali sustentare, educare
aurem ud satietatem perpetuam
educere (where he also quotes
this passage).

99. recreare ‘create anew'.
‘Gives us, as ’twere‚ new life,
when dead with hunger’ (Tuonx-
Tox).—mcdicina1nfacere seems
to have been a technical expres-
sion, cf. Ciste11.1 1, 76. Just
as medicinam sacere=mederi,
so iu Greek θεραπείαν ποιεῖσθαι
-- θεραπεύειν.

100. escae maxumae ‘of lordly
appetite’ (mousson), gen. of
quality. Brix quotes Cic. ad
fam. 1x 26 multi cibi hospes,
Gruter Hor. carm. 1 36, 13
Damalis multi meri.

101. The Cerialia were cele-
brated in the Circus from the
12th to the 19th April. It was
a very popular festival; the
people were then habited in
white and used to feast plenti-
fully. Hence ‘suppers for the
feast of Ceres’ arc plentiful and
splendid entertainments: ‘op-
timae et lautae ac multis ferculis
oneratne’ (Parcus). The spel-
ling Cerialis appears to be much
ruore frequent in the inscrip-
nous and in the mss. than

Cerealis, see the instances col-
lected by Corssen 11 345.—
cena is the proper spelling, not
coena, as the word is from cesna‚
comp. silicernium (instead of
uses-nium). — extruit ‘ builds
up', viz. ‘cibis, ferculis’. ι

102. Struiccs antiqui dIce-
bant ewtructiones omnium rerum
Fnsrvs p. 310 M, who quotes
au instance of Livius Androni-
cus (quo' Castalia pe'r struices
sciseas lapsu decidit v. 37 Ribb.)‚
and Servius on Aen. 1v 267
quotes from Naevius the expres-
sion struix malorum (trag. v. 60
Ribb.). The word is formed with
the same suffix as appears in
cervix cornix coturnix coxendix.
—coucinnare originally means
‘to render harmonious’ (con-l-
εᾶη ‘sing ', whence con-cin-nus
‘ sounding together’ ); here it is
explained by Paulus Festi p. 38
by apte componere. The pro-
nunciation co‘ncinna‘t is like
‹iclludo‘s v. 30.—patinariu3 an
adj. coined by Plautus who has
it here and Asin. 1 3, 283 comp.
escarius above v. 93.

103. dc summo, from the top
of the dish.

104. Nearly the same line
occurs Rud. 1 2, 49 ‘nunc inter-
vallum iam hos dies multos suit.

,. The pronoun refers to the past

immediately preceding. The
parasite means to say that for
