PROLOGVS.

Salutem primum iarn zi principio propitiam

mihi atque vobis, spectatores, nuntio. ⁸
apporto vobis Plautum lingua, non manu:

quaeso (lt benignis accipiatis auribus.

5 nunc argumentum accipite atque animum advortite: 5
quam potero in verba conferam paucissuma.

atque h6c poetae faciunt in comoediis:

After v. 6 R. places the two lines v. 11 and 12. We have main-
tained the arrangement of the mss. 7. atqui R. against the mss,

For the authorship of the
prologues prefixed to the Plaut-
ine plays see my note on the
prologues to the Trinummus
and to the Aulularia. The pre-
sent prologue is by no means a
{izifflffsffiffiiffffi ³2³1} ¹³33
facts mentioned in it are de-
rived from the play itself, and
are generally commumcated in
the very words of the play.
This prologue is, moreover‚ made
up of two different pieces, the
first of which terminates at v.
6, and formed originally part of
a shorter prologue.

1. The expression salus pro-
pitia seems to occur only here.
The adj. propitius is generally
and in earlier Latin almost ex-
clusively applied to persons,
but in Trin. 837 we read paz

propitia. The original sense of ·

opitius would seem to be
‘bending forward' in a listening

attitude‚ as of a god listening
to the prayers of men.

3. A foolish joke. apporto
Plantam should of course be
understood ‘I bring you a play
of Plautus’3 apportare being the
technical term for announcing a
performance (comp. Ter. Phorm.
prol. 24).

6. The present line would
seem to announce a short pro-
logne, but then what tedious-
ness does the author afterwards
bestow upon us! Very prob-
ably, these lines formed the
introduction to a much shorter
prologue than the one with
which they are now connected.

7. The lines 7-16 forming
a detached fragment of some
prologue, it is impossible (or at
least unadvisable) to guess the
original sense of atque, which
is of course dependent on the
sentence originally preceding it.
