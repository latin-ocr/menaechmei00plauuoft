910. It is anything but ne-
cessar-3⁷ to assume that a line
has dropped out before this, as
was done by Ladewig. The
physieiau comes upon Menaech-
mus with his salutation and his
questions, without leaving him
time to answer the first or

even to notice his approach.—
We should assume that Me-
naechmus had buried his head
in his hands, and in so doing
had uncovered his arm, as his
pallium would then naturally
fall back.

912. Menaechmus is in a
very bad temper, owing to his
adventures during the after-
noon, and therefore returns a
somewhat rough answer to the
inquiries of the officious quaok.

913. ‘This case cannot be
cured with an ointment of
hellebore'. The observation is
of course addressed to the old
man, and not to Menaechmus.
Heuebore was used as a sove-
reign remedy against insanity.
