275 sed eccum Menaechmum video. vae tergo meo:
prius iam convivae obambulant ante ostium,

⁴* * * * quis ego sim?

uideon. e terno B, emended by Gruter. 276. ambulant mem,
corrected by R. 278 sq. cli te amabunt quisquis eqo sim mss.‚
emended by R, who proposes the following supplement for v. 279:
tun hanc scis qui sit, qui sciat] quis 690 siem. 280. ubi sunt
com-irae R. 282. certe mss, emended by R. 285. om. in an
mss. except the palimpsest. R. proposes the following supple-
ment:

ΟΥ. Peniculum. [Max. quis is Peniculust aut] ubi is est meus?
286. tuom added by R„ om. mss. 289. pretii mss, emended by

275. vae ειη-σο meo ‘woe to
my back'. He is of course afraid
of punishment for having been
too long in getting the pro-
visions.

276. obambulare occurs also
Capt.111 1,31. Trin. 315. Poen.
prol. 19, and should also be
restored Cas. 1v 1, 10 vestitus
laute ex6rnatusque obambulat,
the sense being ‘he walks up
and down in expectation of
something to eome'.

277. opsonatu = ab obsonan-
do. So again v. 283.

278. di te amabunt is a for-
mula expressing thanks; see
note on Triu. 384.

280. The hiatus in the eae-
sura of the iambis senarius is
justified by the change of speak-
erS, which necessitates a strong
pauso. The cook uses the pln-

ral convivae ceteri, as he had
previously declared the parasite
to be equal to eight. The co-
pula sant is sometimes omitted
in pointed questions ; e. g. Asin.
1 3, 44 ubi illaec quae dedi an-
te.² Ter. Eun. 1v 7, 10 ubi
alii? Andr. 111 1, 19 num im-
memores discipali?

282. certo ‘for certain, to
be snre’. certe means‘at least’.

283. Cicero would have said
nonne dixi ‘have Ι not told
you'. Plautus does not use
nonne, as has been shown by
A. Spengel (ulie Partikel nonne
im Altlateffl’, Mum‘ch 1867);
he employs -ne in its place.

285. See crit. note.

286. The slave observes that
he has his master‘s ‘ peniculus'
(‘dishclout’) sate in his wellet.
