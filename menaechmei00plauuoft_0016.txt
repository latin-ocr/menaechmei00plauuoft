10. xe--inr icem is foreign to
tho stylo of Plautus, aa was
pointed out by Brix on Capt.

adverbial accusative with a pos-
sessive pronoun (nostram or
meam vicem) or a genitive (eri

in vicem ‘ by turns ' occurs Amph.
arg. 11 6, in the present place,
and Mil. Gl. 11 1, 72 in a scene

ot un·P1autine origin. As han
been shown byJ. N. Ott (Jahrb
109p .863)‚ se-invicem does not
occur before Tacims (Agr. 6.
Dial. 25 2) and Pliny the young-
er (111 7‚15); it is, however,
very common in t’he second
half of the second centmy after
Christ, and occurs four times
in Justinus, who has also invi-
cem sibi xm 4, 4. This fact
may be of use in fixing tho

chronological date of these -ar- ,

guments.
