Lachmann's, iunyere mss. 916. R. supplies mcfgyni refert qui colos
sit. 917. tu, royas Bothe, w me interroqas mSS. 919. squamosas

11 2, 137. Lucian, vit. auct. 23
οὐ θέμις γενέσθαι σοφόν, ἢν μὴ
τρὶς ἐφεξῆς τοῦ ἐλλεβόρου πίῃς.
The proper spelling is without
the h, though the dictionaries
stin prefer to register the word
under H.

916. See our crit. note. Me-¹

naechmus is indignant at these
prying questions, as he is not
acquainted with the motive
which prompts them. The
physician would then inform
him that the colour oi the wine
was of great importunae fot the
health of a patient.

917. The diminutive pri-
mulum reeurs below v. 1116.
See also Ter. Ad. 289.

919. The spelling squamos-
εαε is here given by the ms,
B, and has therefore been re-
tained in our edition, though
there is no doubt that Plautus
himself did not write 80, as the

doubling of eonsonants was not
praetised in his time. But the
ss in the suffix ossa· is memor-
able as a trace of ann originally
contained in it, as the archaia
form was onso- or rather antia,
oorresponding to the Greek όεις,
i.e. ocum—See our note on
Trin. 37.

920. deliramenta ‘stuff and
nonsense’, λήρους καὶ φλυαρίας.
Τ116 phrase deliramenta loqui
occurs also Amph. 11 2, 64.
Capt. 111 4, 66.

921. The. suffix of the third
person sing. it appears long in
percipi& see Introd. to Aul. p.
16. It should, however, be
observed that we should expect
percipiat, were we to go by the
rules of Ciceronian syntax.—
For the expression itself, Lam-
binus aptly compares Amph. v
1, 66 nam mihi horror membra
misero percipit dictis tuis.
