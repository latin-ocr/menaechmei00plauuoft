after v. 416.

422. intro eamus Guyet, Miiller Pros. p. 581; but

the hiatus in the caesura is quite legitimam. 428. quin R, but
qui of mss. has been justly defended by Fleckeisen—opera om.

422. etiam, ‘still' or ‘yet'‚
to bo understood of time.
‘Won⁷t you yet wait for your
parasite ?’

424. secero is another in-
stance of a future perfect used
in the sense of a simple future.

425. amabo ⁶ Ι will asle, a
sense derived from the paren-
thetica] use of amabo, with im-
perativeS, when it means ‘do
this and I will love you for
it’. Brix compares Truc. Π· 4, 19
immo amabo ut hos dies ali-
quos sinas eum esse apud me.

tium of course concludes him
to be quite ready to do any-
thing she demands.

should, perham, rather expect
tho perfect dedisti. There are
other instances in Plautus 'm

which the pluperfect seems to
be used instead of the perfect.

427. opera refers to addi-
tional trimming and other em·
bellishments.

428. The ablative of the in-
definite pronoun qui (orig'mally
‘somehow or other ') is often
used with an asseverative force,
compare atqui. This is espe-
cially seen in the comio style
in the phrases hercle qui, ede-
pol qui, ecastor qui, and quippe
qui. See our notes on Aul.

We should supply operti, as
appears from the passages
quoted in my note on Trin.
578. In the present place, it
is very probable that opera was
h'kewise added by the poet him-
self, though it was omitted by
careless scribes,
