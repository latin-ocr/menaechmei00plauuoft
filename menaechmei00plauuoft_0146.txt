—For the gap after this line,

1145. credo is said by way
of parenthesis, according to the
general habit of Latin writers.

1146. Messenio addresses
these words to Menaechmus of
Epidamnus, who had once be-
fore presented him with his
freedom. ‘ 1 hope you have no
objection to my manumission'.
—iusez=iussisti; comp.v. 1030.

1148. It has been pointed
out that as yet no mention had

been made in this scene of
Messenio’s name, and that it is
therefore rather strange that
Menaechmus of Epidamnus
should au of a sudden address
him by his name. This is
either due to a certain negli-
genoe on the ‘part of the poet,
or we should assume that the
scribes have skipped some line
111 which the name was pre-
viously mentioned—The words
quom tu liber σε, qaudeo form
the usual congratulation when a
slave obtains his freedom.
