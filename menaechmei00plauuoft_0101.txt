745. simitu is a Plautine
word instead of simul: see our
note on Trin. 223. simi tu cum
Porthaone ποι-ι’ means ‘ I know
you as well as Porthaon ’‚ i. e. 1
know neither one nor the other.
The reading of the mSS. Por-
thaon has been defended by
Bergk, who supplies a reference
to Polyaenus vr 1, 6, where it
is stated oi Meriones: Μη-
ριόνης ὁέ, ἐπειδή τις ἤγγειλεν αὐ-
τῷ πεπορθῆσθαι τὴν οἰκίαν,
δεξάμενος τὸ οἰώνισμα ὄνομα ἔθετο
τῷ παιδίῳ (a son who had just
been born to him) Πορθάονα.
Porthaon was the legendary fa-
ther of Oeneus, king oi Aetolia.

746. at is very emphatic at
the head of the apodosis. In
prose we might also use tamen
or attamen.

747. advenit is the present,
not the perfect—quin respicis,
*won't you look round’ to see
the old man.

748. Menaechmus returns an
answer in the same style as v.
745. Calcha is a heteroclitio
ablativo instead of Calchante,

see BUcheler, Lat. Decl. p. 6.

749. eodem should be pro-
nounced in two syllables, by
way of synizesis.

750. This line is divided
into two halves by the caesura
falling after the third foot.
This is highly effective in rend-
ering the excited and angry
speech of the iniuriated woman.

751. In εἰ avom the hiatus
is legitimam—vis is somewhat
strange instead of velis or vv-
lueri&

752. hoc, sc. facis: ‘you be·
have in this affair just as you
are in the habit of doing in
other matters ', i. e. always im-
pudently.

Aer V., Sc. 11. The old
man first recites a short can-
ticum highly characteristic of
his mind and manners. The
metre is so well adapted to the
situation that we almost fancy
that we see the feeble old man
tottering along as he pro-
nounces each line.

753. ut aetas meast ‘ as well
as my age shall permit me'.—
