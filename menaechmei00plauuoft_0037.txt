iteration of perae would seem to indicate too much impatience on
the part of Menaechmus. 151. eo R, ο or οΙι the mss 155. atque
hunc comburamis diem Bb. R. considers this line as the combined
fragments of two, which he prints in this 1113111011-

{— ἢ -Ι-
ὗ {- ff {-

clam uxoremst fibi sepulcrum habebimus
atque huuc comburamus diem.

In the first line he would insert mciyis sapis mmo. mIm; in the

phrases is merely a synonym of
velle, but the reason of this
employment of the verb is not
given. Comp.also Truc.1v 3,44,
and in the present play v. 697.

150. The parasite refuses to
pay Menaechmus any further
compliments before knowing
the reason for which he is ex-
pected to be polite.

151. ‘Iubet Menaechmus sup-
parasitari sibi parasitum: at
ille renuit blandiri gratis, nisi
sciat qua mercede: atque ob
eam causam, inquit, diligentius
abs te mihi caveo et praescire
certo praemium cupio, quia
litigium tibi audivi cum uxore
esse, ut haud facile me domum
sis ad cenam vocaturus’. Acr-
mmws, Divinationes in Plau-
tum p. 253.—-caute cavere is one
of those numerous phrases in
which a verb is emphasized by
an adverb ⁰f. the same root,
compare propere properare, cur-
tim currere, memoriter memi-
nisse and others in Plautus.

152. The gap probably con-
tained a thought somewhat like
the following: ‘ne‘ time: si do‘m1:
περαίαν, tcimen uobis praest6st
locus.

155. sepulcrum habere should
be understood oi holding the
burial feast, which used to take
place after the body had been
burnt. Hence also the expres-
sion comburere diem, as if the
day were dead—his candles
burnt out. (Lamb. compares
Horace's condere dlem carm. 1v
5, 29.) The principal meal, the
cena, was taken in the evening.
The simile is continued in the
following lines.

155. orare was aneiently
used in the simple sense of di-
cere. Hence aequom oras means
‘you make a just observation’.
—quam mox ‘how soon'‚ i.e.
shall I not very soon light the
funeral pyre‘? Compare Livy
111 37, 5. Festus, p. 261, says
‘quam moa: siymficat cito ’.
