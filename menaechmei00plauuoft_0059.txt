sternite lectos,

incendite odores: munditia
inlecebra animo sit amantum.
amanti amoenitas malost, nobis lucrost. ⁵
sed ubi illest, quem coquos ante aedis ait esse?

‘atque eccum video,

qui mi est usui et plurumum prodest.
item huic ultro fit, ut meret, potissumus nostrae ut

te hic stare foris, fores quateant
magis, quam domus tua, domus quom haec

stat. 351. sqq. The editors differ considerably in arranging the
first lines of this canticum. Β. s reading is as follows:

sine foris sic: abi.

nolo opperiri: intus para, cura. vide.
We have followed the distribution of the two lines such as it is in

Ennius). Erotium has, as we

here she speaks as if Menaech-
mus were the greatest favourite.

361. Observe the endearing
diminutive in Erotium's address
to Menaechmus. In the same
manner, a favourite modern
Greek way of addressing beloved

comp. Trin. 861 mira sunt with
our note.

362. sore‘s quoi should be
read as an anapaest. For sori-s
see Introd. to Aul. 39 sq.

363. The words domus tua

joined with the subjunctive even
in Plautus. This subj. is,
