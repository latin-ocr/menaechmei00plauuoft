463. 246. cordi sit carus all mss, except the palimpsest. 249. A
very difficult line, not yet satisfactorily emended. fac cessas
datum edis caveas B, facessas doctum et discaveas Camerarius
(facessas et discaveas had already been found by Saracenas), and
so also R. I have adopted Brix's reading, which is, however, far
from being absolutely convincing. 250. hem R. at the end of this
line. All the mss. read em, justly adopted by R„ N. Pl. Exc. 1 p. 74
and Brix, whom we follow in placing it at the beginning of the
next line. 251. isim csse R.. but in his N. Pl. Exo. 1 p. 74 he
prefers ill6c enim vet-bod, saying that no one capable os appre—

245. vivos=si vivo or quam- an account of a voyage. A very

diu vivo. The whole line is thus
paraphrased by Lambinus ‘ve-
rum nisi aliquem invenero qui
mihi liquido confirmet fratrem
meum esse mortuum, quamdiu
vivam, numquam id quod in-
stitui desistam exsequi’.

246. illum is an instance of
the anticipation of the subject
of the dependent clause, instead
of eqo (Ι alone) scio quam carus
ille sit cordi me0.

247. The expression was pro-
verbial of a foolish and un-
profitable occupation: see Do-
natus and the other commen-
tators on Ter. Andr. v 4, 38.
The old English translator, W.
W. (1595) simply says ‘ This is
washing of a blackamore’‚ and
Thornton compares the proverb
‘you are secking for a needle in
a bottle of hay‘.-quin ‘why
not’. The question suggests a

249. ‘Si pergis mihi ob-
strepere ct verbis istis doctis
atque argutis adversari, non
procul abs te aberit infortunium
et malum ’. LAMB. — dc'ctum
doctum occurs also Trin. 380,
where see our note. dictum
facessere lit. ‘to despatch a say-
ing' (not ‘to be done with it',
as is wrongly stated in Smith²s
Dict. s. v. facesso, compare the
expression rem. facessere Rud.
Π 4,17) means ‘to pour forth
wise sayings’. See, however,
also crit. note. —malmn= ver-
bera (Trin. 1045).

250. tuo modo ‘in your way‘.
Lambinus quotes meo modo (⁴in
my own style’) from Ter. Andr.
1 1, 126, and Brix from Pers.
111 1, 31.

Aul. 633.—em'm ‘to be sure’:
the final m should be dropt,
thus making -oc έηὶ- a dactyl.
