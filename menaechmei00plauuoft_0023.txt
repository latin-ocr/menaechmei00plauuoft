42. indere, though not ex-
actly a Ciceronian word, is much
used in archaic and silver latin-
ity. See dict. Observa the con·
struction indit nomen Menaech-
mo ‘he names him Menaech-
mus'.

44. eodem should be pro-
nounced in two syllables (cf.

46. Lambinus asks ‘a qui-
bus flagitarier? ’ and adds ⁶ a vo-
bis’, evidently suggesting that
the performance to which this
prologus was prefixed, took
place by special request of the
public, who were desirous to see
the play once more upon the

any one knew of the boy' s where-

stance of Eutychus Merc. 111 4,

78 sq., and of Giton in Petro-
m'us c. 97; in the latter place
we meet with the very same
expression as here, c. 92: iuve-
m's non minore clamoris indis]-
natione Gitona flayitabat.
