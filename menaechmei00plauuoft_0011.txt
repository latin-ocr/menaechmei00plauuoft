abounds 111 comio power. The single situations of the
plot do not, indeed, originate from an inner cause which
fumishos the creative power of thoni, but arise all the
more powerfnlly from mere fancy and an inexhaustible
fund of boisterous humour, prompted by Chance itself,
the real deity os Comedy. The plot is of less depth than
the Aulularia, but it surpasses that play in its almost in-
describuble power of amusing, and is after all constructed
in such a manner that we cannot mistake Chance for
blind accident or unreason. All these mistakes are to a
certain extent justified by the original relation of the two
brothers, who must needs be brought together again—and
this forms a kind of fate or necessity, which deepens the
interest of the plot. If two strangers were mistaken for
each other in the same surprising manner, we should
consider the whole to be altogether exaggerated.⁷'

The ‘ Menaechmei’ belonged to the first comedies imi-
tated in modern literature. The earliest regular comedy
of modern times was founded on the Menaechmei. This
is the Cala‘ndm of Bibbiena (afterwards a cardinal); it
was represented at Venice in 1508, though not published
till 1524 ¹. It would seem that the ‘ Calandra' was also
the earliest play performed by the Italian actors at the
court of Henry IL, King of Franco ², and the plot may
thus be supposed to have been a favourite with the public
of the 16th century. In England a prose-translation of
the Menaechmei, by ‘ W. W.‚' was printed in 1595 3 but a
Historia qf Error is mentioned as having been performed
by the Children of Paul's ‘on N ew yeres daie at night '
157 6—7. The same piece was acted at NVindsor in 1583.
In 1594 a Comedys (gf Errors (·' like to Plautus his
Menaechmus ') was acted at Gray's Inn. Shakspere's
