pinthia mss„ emended by R. 413. After this line a gap was
pointed out by Ladewig, who likewise discovered the gap

b. Chr. a tyr-ant of Agrigentum
of the name of Φιντίας, and it is
possible that Plautus makes
Erotium mistake one Sicilian
tyrant for another.

411. Α tyr ant of Syracuse
of the namo of Liparo is alto-
gether unknown· m history ,nor
did Hiero ascend the throne by
quiet succession. He was elect-
ed στρατηγὸς in 269, and be·
came king· m 265.

413. In a gap which has
been iustly assumed after this
line, Erotium should be sup
posed to have repeated her in-
vitation. A supposition of this
kind is absolutely necessary on
account of the expression per·
neqan· in the following line.

415, perneqare :persistere in

neqando. Menaechmus had
twice already declined Ero-
tium's invitations.

416. periisti, ‘yon are as
good as lost ’.—intrassis=in-

trave-sis: intraveris. —For τᾶοέ

see Introdffi. 26.

417. Here a line has dropped
out in which Messenio was
ordered to stand back. Below,
v. 432, he is told to come again
nearer.

419. si, ‘if perhaps ¹.

420. non inprudens-:consul-
to.—-advorsari, ‘ speak against ’,
i.e. say the contrary of what
another says—In hune metue-
bam ne renuntiaret we have an
instance of ‘ anticipatio ’‚ so
common in Plautus.
